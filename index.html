            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>My name is Mila, and I am a Computational Social Science Masters student at UC San Diego.
                I am deeply interested in leveraging technology to enhance both physical and mental healthcare. 
                Specifically, I am passionate about utilizing artificial intelligence to improve digital therapeutics, 
                making healthcare more accessible and personalized. By integrating AI into therapeutic tools, I aim to 
                create solutions that provide better, more efficient care for individuals, especially those with limited 
                access to traditional healthcare services.

            <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
            <p>As a passionate researcher, I have engaged in various projects that bridge the fields of psychology, AI, and human-computer interaction. Below are some highlights of my research experience:</p>

            <h3>INFINITUS AI</h3>
            <p><strong>Capstone Project Intern</strong><br>
            <em>Currently Working On</em></p>
            <p>As part of my ongoing graduate capstone project, I have been working with <strong>INFINITUS AI</strong>, a company that specializes in developing advanced conversational AI solutions to health insurance follow up calls. In my role, I conduct experiments with diverse participant groups to evaluate the effectiveness of different AI agent versions in real-world applications. These experiments focused on collecting both quantitative and qualitative feedback on AI agent usability and likability.</p>
            <p>I also analyzed user interactions and feedback to refine the conversational AI features, adjusting the tone, responsiveness, and overall engagement of the AI agents. These improvements lead to better user satisfaction metrics and a more seamless user experience, highlighting my ability to integrate human-centered design principles with AI technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Research Assistant</strong><br>
            <em>August 2022 - June 2023</em><br>
            <strong>Clinical Psychology Lab, Professor Hannah Raila</strong></p>
            <p>At UC Santa Cruz, I collaborated with Professor Hannah Raila in the clinical psychology lab, where we conducted research on the intersection of emotion, cognition, and psychopathology. A key aspect of my work was designing and programming a novel study that utilized the <strong>Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS)</strong> methodology. This study was focused on assessing visual awareness in individuals with contamination Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).</p>
            <p>My responsibilities included conducting extensive literature reviews, programming experiments using <strong>Matlab & Python</strong>, and creating surveys in <strong>Qualtrics</strong> to collect feedback on visual stimuli. This research helped improve our understanding of how individuals with OCD process and react to visual stimuli under suppressed awareness conditions.</p>

            <em>August 2022 - June 2023</em><br>
            <strong>Cognitive Psychology Lab, Professor Hannah Hausman</strong></p>
            <p>I also contributed to Professor Hannah Hausman's cognitive psychology laboratory, which focused on memory and metacognition. In this lab, I provided support to PhD students in various aspects of their research, including designing and conducting human subject testing, programming, and assisting with literature reviews.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I helped organize and analyze research data, often using tools such as <strong>Excel</strong> to streamline data processing and ensure the accuracy of our findings. This experience strengthened my analytical and programming skills, and allowed me to contribute to cutting-edge research in cognitive psychology.</p>

            <h3>Computational Social Science</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Research Topic:</strong> Maternal Mortality. 
                This project investigates the factors influencing global maternal mortality rates, using data from 2015. 
                Maternal mortality refers to deaths caused by complications during pregnancy or childbirth, 
                a critical public health issue as approximately 84% of these deaths are preventable.
